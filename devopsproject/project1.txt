Question 1

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migratic of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud.
Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps  
rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, 
more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases,
ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the 
migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, 
allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

For this task, create a key pair with the following requirements:
    • Name of the key pair should be xfusion-kp.
    • Key pair type must be rsa

steps what i followed
    Below are the **clear, correct steps** for this **DevOps project task** (AWS Key Pair creation), written so you can **use it directly in your GitHub project**.

    ## Project Steps: AWS Key Pair Creation (xfusion-kp)

    ### Step 1: Login to AWS Console

    * Open a web browser
    * Login to **AWS Management Console**
    * Select the correct **region** (example: `us-east-1`)

    **Purpose:**
    AWS resources are region-specific.

    ---

    ### Step 2: Navigate to EC2 Service

    * Go to **Services → EC2**
    * From the left menu, click **Key Pairs** (under *Network & Security*)

    **Purpose:**
    Key pairs are managed inside EC2.

    ---

    ### Step 3: Create a New Key Pair

    * Click **Create key pair**
    * Enter details:

    * **Key pair name:** `xfusion-kp`
    * **Key pair type:** `RSA`
    * **Private key file format:** `.pem`

    **Purpose:**
    RSA key pairs are used for secure SSH authentication.

    ---

    ### Step 4: Download the Key File

    * AWS will automatically download:

    ```
    xfusion-kp.pem
    ```
    * Save it in a secure location

    ⚠️ **Important:**
    If you lose this file, it **cannot be downloaded again**.

    ---

    ### Step 5: Set Correct Permissions (Linux/Mac)

    ```bash
    chmod 400 xfusion-kp.pem
    ```

    **Purpose:**
    SSH requires strict file permissions for private keys.

    ---

    ### Step 6: Connect to EC2 Instance Using the Key

    ```bash
    ssh -i xfusion-kp.pem ubuntu@<ec2-public-dns>
    ```

    **Purpose:**
    Verifies that the key pair works correctly.

    ---

    ### Step 7: Verify Successful Login

    * If login succeeds, the key pair is working
    * No password will be required

    ---

    ## Expected Outcome

    * RSA key pair **xfusion-kp** created successfully
    * Secure SSH access enabled
    * Task completed following DevOps best practices

    ---

    ## Why This Approach Is Used

    * Prevents insecure password login
    * Supports **incremental cloud migration**
    * Improves security and access control

## Interview Questions & Answers – DevOps Project

### 1️⃣ What is the goal of this project?

**Answer:**
The goal is to support a phased AWS cloud migration by securely setting up access to EC2 instances using an RSA key pair, following DevOps best practices.

---

### 2️⃣ Why did the team choose incremental migration instead of a single migration?

**Answer:**
Incremental migration reduces risk, minimizes downtime, improves control, and allows easier troubleshooting during each phase of the migration.

---

### 3️⃣ What is an AWS key pair?

**Answer:**
An AWS key pair is a set of public and private keys used for secure, password-less authentication when connecting to EC2 instances via SSH.

---

### 4️⃣ Why is RSA used for the key pair?

**Answer:**
RSA is a widely supported and secure encryption algorithm used by AWS for SSH access, making it suitable for production environments.

---

### 5️⃣ What is the name of the key pair created in your project?

**Answer:**
The key pair name is **`xfusion-kp`**.

---

### 6️⃣ Where is the private key stored?

**Answer:**
The private key (`xfusion-kp.pem`) is downloaded by the user and stored securely on the local system. AWS does not store private keys.

---

### 7️⃣ What happens if the `.pem` file is lost?

**Answer:**
If the key file is lost, it cannot be downloaded again. A new key pair must be created and associated with the EC2 instance.

---

### 8️⃣ Why do we change permissions to `400` for the key file?

**Answer:**
SSH requires strict permissions to ensure the private key is not accessible by others, improving security.

---

### 9️⃣ How do you connect to an EC2 instance using the key pair?

**Answer:**
Using the SSH command:

```bash
ssh -i xfusion-kp.pem ubuntu@<ec2-public-dns>
```

---

### 🔟 What security benefit does key-based authentication provide?

**Answer:**
It eliminates password-based logins, reducing the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ In which AWS service are key pairs managed?

**Answer:**
Key pairs are managed under the **EC2 service** in AWS.

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Why is region selection important when creating key pairs?

**Answer:**
AWS key pairs are region-specific and must be created in the same region as the EC2 instance.

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ How does this project reflect DevOps principles?

**Answer:**
It follows automation readiness, security-first design, incremental implementation, and proper documentation using version control.

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ What real-world scenario does this project represent?

**Answer:**
It represents secure access management during cloud infrastructure migration.

---

### 1️⃣5️⃣ How can this project be improved or extended?

**Answer:**
It can be extended by:

* Automating key creation with AWS CLI
* Using IAM roles
* Adding CI/CD pipelines
* Using Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform
